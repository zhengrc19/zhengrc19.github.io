Hi! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Google, located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Thank you for visiting my page!

Prior to Google, I was a Data Scientist at the Powertrain Data team of <a href='https://lucidmotors.com/'>Lucid Motors</a>.

In Summer 2023, I obtained my bachelor's degree as Outstanding Graduate (优秀毕业生) from the <a href='https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Department of Computer Science and Technology (CST)</a>, <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Tsinghua University (THU)</a>. 

My research interests include robot and reinforcement learning, with publications listed <a href='publications'>here</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href='http://hxu.rocks'>Huazhe Xu</a> at the <a href='https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)</a>, Tsinghua University. I try to look for problems in the real world which can be solved with artificial intelligence.

My experiences cover both the industry and the academia, mainly in deep learning and software engineering. In Spring 2023, I was the teaching assistant of IIIS's Deep Reinforcement Learning course. Prior to that, I was also the instructor/TA of 4 courses, listed <a href='teaching'>here</a>. In Summer 2022, I was an Algorithm Engineer Intern at <a href='http://kuaishou.cn/'>Kuaishou</a>, focusing on causal inference and discovery.

I watch European football, specifically the <a href='https://www.premierleague.com/'>English Premier League</a> and <a href='https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/'>UEFA Champions League</a>. I have been a fan of <a href='https://www.mancity.com/'>Manchester City FC</a> since 2013. My sports interests include football (both American and European), volleyball, and badminton.
