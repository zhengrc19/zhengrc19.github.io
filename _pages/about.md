<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I am a senior year undergrad at the Department of Computer Science and Technology (CST), Tsinghua University. Thank you for visiting my page!

My research interests include robot and reinforcement learning. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href='http://hxu.rocks'>Huazhe Xu</a> at the <a href='https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/'>Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)</a>, Tsinghua University. I am also the teaching assistant of IIIS's 2023 Deep Reinforcement Learning course.

I watch European football, specifically the <a href='https://www.premierleague.com/'>English Premier League</a> and <a href='https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/'>UEFA Champions League</a>. I support <a href='https://www.mancity.com/'>Manchester City FC</a>. My sports interests include football (both American and European), volleyball, and badminton.
