## **Introduction to $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$** (2020)
##### Course Instructor 
For various reasons, $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$ is much more difficult to use than Microsoft Word, and has a steeper learning curve. This course gives a general introduction to $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$ by teaching the basics of it. The main goal is to help students format their papers in a professional manner, and prepare for their future research careers.

## **Python Programming** (2018)
##### Course Instructor
This course teaches the fundamentals of programming with the Python programming language. Basic concepts like variables, data types, functions, control flows, loops, and object-oriented programming are covered. The content is mainly based off of the massive open online course (MOOC) <a href='/learning/#ltp'>Learn to Program: The Fundamentals</a> by University of Toronto, which I personally found very easy to follow.
