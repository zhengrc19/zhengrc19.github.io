  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Predicting bike sharing demand can help bike sharing companies to allocate bikes better and ensure a more sufficient circulation of bikes for customers. This paper proposes a real-time method for predicting bike renting and returning in different areas of a city during a future period based on historical data, weather data, and time data. We construct a network of bike trips from the data, use a community detection method on the network, and find two communities with the most demand for shared bikes. We use data of stations in the two communities as our dataset, and train an deep LSTM model with two layers to predict bike renting and returning, making use of the gating mechanism of long short term memory and the ability to process sequence data of recurrent neural network. We evaluate the model with the Root Mean Squared Error of data and show that the prediction of proposed model outperforms that of other deep learning models by comparing their RMSEs.},
